This class is taught by [Prof. Srikumar Ramalingam](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~srikumar/), which provides the introduction to fundamental concepts in
computer vision. Topics in this class include camera pose estimation,
3D reconstruction, feature detectors and descriptors, object
recognition using vocabulary tree, segmentation, stereo matching,
graph cuts, belief propagation, and a brief introduction to deep
neural networks.  In the assignments, the students will be expected to
implement basic computer vision tasks such as segmentation, stereo
reconstruction, image matching using vocabulary tree, and small
computer vision applications using deep neural networks.
